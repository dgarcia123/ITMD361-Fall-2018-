  <p><i> Hello world. This is my first website! ~ Danny </i></p>

<p> My name is Danny Garcia and I am a second year Computer Science student studying here at Illinois Institute of Technology. I hope to someday be an amazing software developer, hopefully making an amazing salary. Quite honestly the main reason I am so into technology is because it fascinates me so much, slowly but surely making a world that seems impossible become possible! Another reason is because I want to escape the low-income family that I was born into and reach the upper-class to see how much fun life can be with money, though I tend to give the other reason whenever people ask why I chose to study Computer Science. Anyways, I am excited to learn the fundamentals of web development so that I can have that foundation to soar off of!
